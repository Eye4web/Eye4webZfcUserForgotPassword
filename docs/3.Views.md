# Views

`Eye4web\ZfcUser\ForgotPassword` already includes views, but you are able to edit them to suit your needs.

## How to

[Click here to see the view folder](https://github.com/Eye4web/Eye4webZfcUserForgotPassword/tree/master/view)

1. Add the folder `view/zfc-user-forgot-password/` and `view/zfc-user-forgot-password/confirmation` in your Application.
