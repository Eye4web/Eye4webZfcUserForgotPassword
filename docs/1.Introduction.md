# Introduction

Eye4web\ZfcUser\ForgotPassword is a forgot password module for ZfcUser 1.*.
You can choose your e-mail transporter yourself, but works out of the box using [`Soflomo/Mail`](https://github.com/Soflomo/Mail)

There is no need for configuration except if you want to use another email transporter than `Soflomo/Mail`.
